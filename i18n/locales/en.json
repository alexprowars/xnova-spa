		"1": "Metal is the primary resource used in the foundation of your Empire. At greater depths, the mines can produce more output of viable metal for use in the construction of buildings, ships, defense systems, and research. As the mines drill deeper, more energy is required for maximum production. As metal is the most abundant of all resources available, its value is considered to be the lowest of all resources for trading.",
		"2": "Crystals are the main resource used to build electronic circuits for computers and other electronic circuits and form certain alloy compounds for shields. Compared to the metal production process, the processing of raw crystalline structures into industrial crystals requires special processing. As such, more energy is required to process the raw crystal than needed for metal. Development of ships and buildings, and specialized research upgrades, require a certain quantity of crystals.",
		"3": "Deuterium is also called heavy hydrogen. It is a stable isotope of hydrogen with a natural abundance in the oceans of colonies of approximately one atom in 6500 of hydrogen (~154 PPM). Deuterium thus accounts for approximately 0.015% (on a weight basis, 0.030%) of all. Deuterium is processed by special synthesizers which can separate the water from the Deuterium using specially designed centrifuges. The upgrade of the synthesizer allows for increasing the amount of Deuterium deposits processed. Deuterium is used when carrying out sensor phalanx scans, viewing galaxies, as fuel for ships, and performing specialized research upgrades.",
		"4": "Gigantic solar arrays are used to generate power for the mines and the deuterium synthesizer. As the solar plant is upgraded, the surface area of the photovoltaic cells covering the planet increases, resulting in a higher energy output across the power grids of your planet.",
		"12": "In fusion power plants, hydrogen nuclei are fused into helium nuclei under enormous temperature and pressure, releasing tremendous amounts of energy. For each gram of Deuterium consumed, up to 41,32*10^-13 Joule of energy can be produced; with 1 g you are able to produce 172 MWh energy.<br><br>Larger reactor complexes use more deuterium and can produce more energy per hour. The energy effect could be increased by researching energy technology.<br><br>The energy production of the fusion plant is calculated like that:<br>30 * [Level Fusion Plant] * (1,05 + [Level Energy Technology] * 0,01) ^ [Level Fusion Plant]",
		"14": "The Robotics Factory primary goal is the production of State of the Art construction robots. Each upgrade to the robotics factory results in the production of faster robots, which is used to reduce the time needed to construct buildings.",
		"15": "A nanomachine, also called a nanite, is a mechanical or electromechanical device whose dimensions are measured in nanometers (millionths of a millimeter, or units of 10^-9 meter). The microscopic size of nanomachines translates into higher operational speed. This factory produces nanomachines that are the ultimate evolution in robotics technology. Once constructed, each upgrade significantly decreases production time for buildings, ships, and defensive structures.",
		"21": "The planetary shipyard is responsible for the construction of spacecraft and defensive mechanisms. As the shipyard is upgraded, it can produce a wider variety of vehicles at a much greater rate of speed. If a nanite factory is present on the planet, the speed at which ships are constructed is massively increased.",
		"22": "This storage facility is used to store metal ore. Each level of upgrading increases the amount of metal ore that can be stored. If the storage capacity is exceeded, the metal mines are automatically shut down to prevent a catastrophic collapse in the metal mine shafts.",
		"23": "Raw crystal is stored in this building. With each level of upgrade, it increases the amount of crystal can be stored. Once the mines output exceeds the storage capacity, the crystal mines automatically shut down to prevent a collapse in the mines.",
		"24": "The Deuterium tank is for storing newly-synthesized deuterium. Once it is processed by the synthesizer, it is piped into this tank for later use. With each upgrade of the tank, the total storage capacity is increased. Once the capacity is reached, the Deuterium Synthesizer is shut down to prevent the tanks rupture.",
		"31": "An essential part of any empire, Research Labs are where new technologies are discovered, and older technologies are improved upon. With each level of the Research Lab constructed, the speed in which new technologies are researched is increased, while also unlocking newer technologies to research. In order to conduct research as quickly as possible, research scientists are immediately dispatched to the colony to begin work and development. In this way, knowledge about new technologies can easily be disseminated throughout the empire.",
		"33": "With the ever increasing mining of a colony, a problem arose. How can we continue to operate at a planets capacity and still survive? The land is being mined out and the atmosphere is deteriorating. Mining a colony to capacity can not only destroy the planet, but may kill all life on it. Scientists working feverishly discovered a method of creating enormous land masses using nanomachines. The Terraformer was born.<br><br>Once built, the Terraformer cannot be torn down.",
		"34": "The alliance depot supplies fuel to friendly fleets in orbit helping with defense. For each upgrade level of the alliance depot, 10,000 units of deuterium per hour can be sent to an orbiting fleet.",
		"41": "Since a moon has no atmosphere and is an extremely hostile environment, a lunar base must first be built before the moon can be developed. The Lunar Base provides oxygen, heating, and gravity to create a living environment for the colonists. With each level constructed, a larger living and development area is provided within the biosphere. With each level of the Lunar Base constructed, three fields are developed for other buildings. <br>Once built, the lunar base can not be torn down.",
		"42": "Utilizing high-resolution sensors, the Sensor Phalanx first scans the spectrum of light, composition of gases, and radiation emissions from a distant world and transmits the data to a supercomputer for processing. Once the information is obtained, the supercomputer compares changes in the spectrum, gas composition, and radiation emissions, to a base line chart of known changes of the spectrum created by various ship movements. The resulting data then displays activity of any fleet within the range of the phalanx. To prevent the supercomputer from overheating during the process, it is cooled by utilizing 5k of processed Deuterium. To use the Phalanx, click on any planet in the Galaxy View within your sensors range.",
		"43": "A Jump Gate is a system of giant transceivers capable of sending even the largest fleets to a receiving Gate anywhere in the universe without loss of time. Utilizing technology similar to that of a Worm Hole to achieve the jump, deuterium is not required. A recharge period of one hour must pass between jumps to allow for regeneration. Transporting resources through the Gate is not possible.",
		"44": "When Earth destroyed itself in a full scale nuclear exchange back in the 21st century, the technology needed to build such weapons still existed in the universe. Scientists all over the universe worried about the threat of a nuclear bombardment from a rogue leader. So it was decided to use the same technology as a deterrent from launching such a horrible attack.<br><br> Missile silos are used to construct, store and launch interplanetary and anti-ballistic missiles. With each level of the silo, five interplanetary missiles or ten anti-ballistic missiles can be stored. Storage of both Interplanetary missiles and Anti-Ballistic missiles in the same silo is allowed.",
		"106": "Espionage Technology is your intelligence gathering tool. This technology allows you to view your targets resources, fleets, buildings, and research levels using specially designed probes. Launched on your target, these probes transmit back to your planet an encrypted data file that is fed into a computer for processing. After processing, the information on your target is then displayed for evaluation.<br><br> With Espionage Technology, the level of your technology to that of your target is critical. If your target has a higher level of Espionage Technology than you, you will need to launch more probes to gather all the information on your target. However this runs the great risk of detection by your target, resulting in the probes destruction. However, launching too few probes will result in missing information that is most critical, which could result in the total destruction of your fleet if an attack is launched.<br><br>At certain levels of Espionage Technology research, new attack warning systems are installed:<br><br>At Level <span style=\"color: #ff0000\">2</span>, the total number of attacking ships will be displayed along with the simple attack warning.<br>At Level <font color=\"#ff0000\">4</font>, the type of attacking ships along with the number of ships are displayed.<br>At Level <font color=\"#ff0000\">8</font>, the exact number of each type of ship launched is displayed.",
		"108": "Once launched on any mission, fleets are controlled primarily by a series of computers located on the originating planet. These massive computers calculate the exact time of arrival, controls course corrections as needed, calculates trajectories, and regulates flight speeds. <br><br>With each level researched, the flight computer is upgraded to allow an additional slot to be launched. Computer technology should be continuously developed throughout the building of your empire.",
		"109": "Weapons Technology is a key research technology and is critical to your survival against enemy Empires. With each level of Weapons Technology researched, the weapons systems on ships and your defense mechanisms become increasingly more efficient. Each level increases the base strength of your weapons by 10% of the base value.",
		"110": "With the invention of the magnetosphere generator, scientists learned that an artificial shield could be produced to protect the crew in space ships not only from the harsh solar radiation environment in deep space, but also provide protection from enemy fire during an attack. Once scientists finally perfected the technology, a magnetosphere generator was installed on all ships and defence systems. <br><br>As the technology is advanced to each level, the magnetosphere generator is upgraded which provides an additional 10% strength to the shields base value.",
		"111": "The environment of deep space is harsh. Pilots and crew on various missions not only faced intense solar radiation, they also faced the prospect of being hit by space debris, or destroyed by enemy fire in an attack. With the discovery of an aluminum-lithium titanium carbide alloy, which was found to be both light weight and durable, this afforded the crew a certain degree of protection. With each level of Armour Technology developed, a higher quality alloy is produced, which increases the armours strength by 10%.",
		"113": "As various researches were advancing, it was discovered that the current technology of energy distribution was not sufficient enough to begin certain specialized researches. With each upgrade of your Energy Technology, new researches can be conducted which unlocks development of more sophisticated ships and defenses.",
		"114": "In theory, the idea of hyperspace travel relies on the existence of a separate and adjacent dimension. When activated, a hyperspace drive shunts the starship into this other dimension, where it can cover vast distances in an amount of time greatly reduced from the time it would take in \"normal\" space. Once it reaches the point in hyperspace that corresponds to its destination in real space, it re-emerges.<br>Once a sufficient level of Hyperspace Technology is researched, the Hyperspace Drive is no longer just a theory. Each improvement to this drive increases the load capacity of your ships by 5% of the base value.",
		"115": "The Combustion Drive is the oldest of technologies, but is still in use. With the Combustion Drive, exhaust is formed from propellants carried within the ship prior to use. In a closed chamber, the pressures are equal in each direction and no acceleration occurs. If an opening is provided at the bottom of the chamber then the pressure is no longer opposed on that side. The remaining pressure gives a resultant thrust in the side opposite the opening, which propels the ship forward by expelling the exhaust rearwards at extreme high speed.<br> <br>With each level of the Combustion Drive developed, the speed of small and large cargo ships, light fighters, recyclers, and espionage probes are increased by 10%.",
		"117": "The impulse drive is essentially an augmented fusion rocket, usually consisting of a fusion reactor, an accelerator-generator, a driver coil assembly and a vectored thrust nozzle to direct the plasma exhaust. The fusion reaction generates a highly energized plasma. This plasma, (\"electro-plasma\") can be employed for propulsion, or can be diverted through the EPS to the power transfer grid, via EPS conduits, so as to supply other systems. The accelerated plasma is passed through the driver coils, thereby generating a subspace field which improves the propulsive effect. <br><br>With each level of the Impulse Drive developed, the speed of bombers, cruisers, heavy fighters, and colony ships are increased by 20% of the base value. Interplanetary missiles also travel farther with each level.",
		"118": "With the advancement of Hyperspace Technology, the Hyperspace Drive was created. Hyperspace is an alternate region of space co-existing with our own universe which may be entered using an energy field or other device. The HyperSpace Drive utilizes this alternate region by distorting the space-time continuum, which results in speeds that exceed the speed of light (otherwise known as FTL travel). During FTL travel, time and space is warped to the point that results in a trip that would normally take 1000 light years to be completed, to be accomplished in about an hour. <br><br>With each level the Hyperspace Drive is developed, the speed of battleships, battlecruisers, destroyers, and deathstars are increased by 30%.",
		"120": "In physics, a laser is a device that emits light through a specific mechanism for which the term laser is an acronym: Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Lasers have many uses to the empire, from upgrading computer communications systems to the creation of newer weapons and space ships.",
		"121": "Ions can be concentrated and accelerated into a deadly beam. These beams can then inflict enormous damage. Our scientists have also developed a technique that will clearly reduce the deconstruction costs for buildings and systems. For each research level, the deconstruction costs will sink by 4%.",
		"122": "A further development of ion technology that doesn`t speed up ions but high-energy plasma instead, which can then inflict devastating damage on impact with an object. Our scientists have also found a way to noticeably improve the mining of metal and crystal using this technology.<br><br>Metal production increases by 1%, crystal production by 0.66% and deuterium production by 0.33% per construction level of the plasma technology.",
		"123": "This is your deep space network to communicate researches to your colonies. With the IRN, faster research times can be achieved by linking the highest level research labs equal to the level of the IRN developed. <br><br>In order to function, each colony must be able to conduct the research independently.",
		"124": "Further findings in the field of astrophysics allow for the construction of laboratories that can be fitted on more and more ships. This makes long expeditions far into unexplored areas of space possible. In addition these advancements can be used to further colonize the galaxies. For every two levels of this technology an additional planet can be utilized.",
		"150": "Император, имеющий много колоний во вселеной имеет больше преимуществ перед другими. Каждый уровень развития данной технологии увеличивает максимальное количество планет вашей империи на +1.",
		"161": "Обойдя ограничение на количество планет, вы сможете создавать планеты-карлики, которые удобно использовать в качестве промежуточных баз для флота. Максимальная возможность застройки данной территории - 10 полей. Что на ней размещать это решать вам. С каждым уровнем развития данной технологии увеличивается максимальное количество таких баз.",
		"199": "The graviton is an elementary particle that mediates the force of gravity in the framework of quantum field theory. The graviton must be massless (because the gravitational force has unlimited range) and must have a spin of 2 (because gravity is a second-rank tensor field). Graviton Technology is only used for one thing, for the construction of the fearsome DeathStar. <br><br>Out of all of the technologies to research, this one carries the most risk of detection during the phase of preparation.",

		"202": "The first ship built by any emperor, the small cargo is an agile resource moving ship that has a cargo capacity of 5,000 resource units. This multi-use ship not only has the ability to quickly transport resources between your colonies, but also accompanies larger fleets on raiding missions on enemy targets. [Ship refitted with Impulse Drives once reached level 5]",
		"203": "As time evolved, the raids on colonies resulted in larger and larger amounts of resources being captured. As a result, Small Cargos were being sent out in mass numbers to compensate for the larger captures. It was quickly learned that a new class of ship was needed to maximize resources captured in raids, yet also be cost effective. After much development, the Large Cargo was born.<br><br>To maximize the resources that can be stored in the holds, this ship has little in the way of weapons or armor. Thanks to the highly developed combustion engine installed, it serves as the most economical resource supplier between planets, and most effective in raids on hostile worlds.",
		"204": "This is the first fighting ship all emperors will build. The light fighter is an agile ship, but vulnerable by themselves. In mass numbers, they can become a great threat to any empire. They are the first to accompany small and large cargo to hostile planets with minor defenses.",
		"205": "In developing the heavy fighter, researchers reached a point at which conventional drives no longer provided sufficient performance. In order to move the ship optimally, the impulse drive was used for the first time. This increased the costs, but also opened new possibilities. By using this drive, there was more energy left for weapons and shields; in addition, high-quality materials were used for this new family of fighters. With these changes, the heavy fighter represents a new era in ship technology and is the basis for cruiser technology.<br><br>Slightly larger than the light fighter, the heavy fighter has thicker hulls, providing more protection, and stronger weaponry.",
		"206": "With the development of the heavy laser and the ion cannon, light and heavy fighters encountered an alarmingly high number of defeats that increased with each raid. Despite many modifications, weapons strength and armour changes, it could not be increased fast enough to effectively counter these new defensive measures. Therefore, it was decided to build a new class of ship that combined more armor and more firepower. As a result of years of research and development, the Cruiser was born. <br><br>Cruisers are armored almost three times of that of the heavy fighters, and possess more than twice the firepower of any combat ship in existence. They also possess speeds that far surpassed any spacecraft ever made. For almost a century, cruisers dominated the universe. However, with the development of Gauss cannons and plasma turrets, their predominance ended. They are still used today against fighter groups, but not as predominantly as before.",
		"207": "Once it became apparent that the cruiser was losing ground to the increasing number of defense structures it was facing, and with the loss of ships on missions at unacceptable levels, it was decided to build a ship that could face those same type of defense structures with as little loss as possible. After extensive development, the Battleship was born. Built to withstand the largest of battles, the Battleship features large cargo spaces, heavy cannons, and high hyperdrive speed. Once developed, it eventually turned out to be the backbone of every raiding Emperors fleet.",
		"208": "In the 20th Century, Man decided to go for the stars. First, it was landing on the Moon. After that, a space station was built. Mars was colonized soon afterwards. It was soon determined that our growth depended on colonizing other worlds. Scientists and engineers all over the world gathered together to develop mans greatest achievement ever. The Colony Ship is born.<br><br>This ship is used to prepare a newly discovered planet for colonization. Once it arrives at the destination, the ship is instantly transformed into habital living space to assist in populating and mining the new world. 9 Planets maximum can be colonized.",
		"209": "As space battles became larger and more fierce, the resultant debris fields became too large to gather safely by conventional means. Normal transporters could not get close enough without receiving substantial damage. A solution was developed to this problem. The Recycler. <br><br>Thanks to the new shields and specially built equipment to gather wreckage, gathering debris no longer presented a danger. Each Recycler can gather 20,000 units of debris.",
		"210": "Espionage probes are small, agile drones that provide data on fleets and planets. Fitted with specially designed engines, it allows them to cover vast distances in only a few minutes. Once in orbit around the target planet, they quickly collect data and transmit the report back via your Deep Space Network for evaluation. But there is a risk to the intelligent gathering aspect. During the time the report is transmitted back to your network, the signal can be detected by the target and the probes can be destroyed.",
		"211": "Over the centuries, as defenses were starting to get larger and more sophisticated, fleets were starting to be destroyed at an alarming rate. It was decided that a new ship was needed to break defenses to ensure maximum results. After years of research and development, the Bomber was created.<br><br>Using laser-guided targeting equipment and Plasma Bombs, the Bomber seeks out and destroys any defense mechanism it can find. As soon as the hyperspace drive is developed to Level 8, the Bomber is retrofitted with the hyperspace engine and can fly at higher speeds.",
		"212": "It quickly became apparent that more energy was needed to power larger mines then could be produced by conventional ground based solar planets and fusion reactors. Scientists worked on the problem and discovered a method of transmitting electrical energy to the colony using specially designed satellites in geosynchronous orbit.<br><br> Solar Satellites gather solar energy and transmit it to a ground station using advanced laser technology. The efficiency of a solar satellite depends on the strength of the solar radiation it receives. In principle, energy production in orbits closer to the sun is greater than for planets in orbits distant from the sun. Since the satellites primary goal is the transmission of energy, they lack shielding and weapons capability, and because of this they are usually destroyed in large numbers in a major battle. However they do possess a small self-defense mechanism to defend itself in an espionage mission from an enemy empire if the mission is detected.",
		"213": "The Destroyer is the result of years of work and development. With the development of Deathstars, it was decided that a class of ship was needed to defend against such a massive weapon.Thanks to its improved homing sensors, multi-phalanx Ion cannons, Gauss Cannons and Plasma Turrets, the Destroyer turned out to be one of the most fearsome ships created.<br><br>Because the destroyer is very large, its maneuverability is severely limited, which makes it more of a battle station than a fighting ship. The lack of maneuverability is made up for by its sheer firepower, but it also costs significant amounts of deuterium to build and operate.",
		"214": "The Deathstar is the ultimate ship ever created. This moon sized ship is the only ship that can be seen with the naked eye on the ground. By the time you spot it, unfortunately, it is too late to do anything.<br><br> Armed with a gigantic graviton cannon, the most advanced weapons system ever created in the Universe, this massive ship has not only the capability of destroying entire fleets and defenses, but also has the capability of destroying entire moons. Only the most advanced empires have the capability to build a ship of this mammoth size.",
		"215": "This ship is one of the most advanced fighting ships ever to be developed, and is particularly deadly when it comes to destroying attacking fleets. With its improved laser cannons on board and advanced Hyperspace engine, the Battlecruiser is a serious force to be dealt with in any attack.<br><br> Due to the ships design and its large weapons system, the cargo holds had to be cut, but this is compensated for by the lowered fuel consumption.",
		"216": "This high-tech ship, based on the synthesis of dark matter, is capable of expanding your possessions in the universe, thanks to the research of TM you can turn any uninhabited territory into a kind of dwarf planet, where you can create an intermediate base for your fleet. The disadvantages of this technology include a small number of fields for construction.",
		"220": "A multi-purpose combat high-speed maneuverable ship of the Confederation for fighting fighters and attack aircraft, guarding and defending ship formations. It is also used for reconnaissance and patrol services.",
		"221": "Only bionics with their highest level of technological development managed to extract maximum power from \"outdated\" impulse engines. Do you think that the hyperspace engine gives you a significant advantage? Your hopes will quickly disappear when you at least once see how fast an interceptor moves. Possessing good weapons for its class of ships, a group of interceptors can very successfully terrorize developing colonies opponents.",
		"222": "The Cylons never sought to fight. However, the constant raids on their prosperous planets forced the robots to create a new type of military ships controlled by artificial intelligence. And do not be fooled by their massive and clumsy appearance: those who have met a dreadnought in battle know that there will be no mercy.",
		"223": "The Ancients are known in all corners of the galaxy as the most cruel and successful pirates. Although their luck is more like a fairy tale for gullible children. The success of most of the Ancients' sorties is due to the presence of special ships created according to the schemes of heavy fighters. The Ancients managed to establish symbiosis between the structure of the ships and their own bodies. Due to this, ship control became intuitive, the carrying capacity increased significantly, since it became possible to get rid of on-board computers and other unnecessary things, and the enzyme secreted by the body of the Ancients reduced fuel consumption.",		"401": "Your first basic line of defense. These are simple ground based launch facilities that fire conventional warhead tipped missiles at attacking enemy targets. As they are cheap to construct and no research is required, they are well suited for defending raids, but lose effectiveness defending from larger scale attacks. Once you begin construction on more advanced defense weapons systems, Rocket Launchers become simple fodder to allow your more damaging weapons to inflict greater damage for a longer period of time.<br><br>After a battle, there is up to a 70 % chance that failed defensive facilities can be returned to use.",
		"402": "As technology developed and more sophisticated ships were created, it was determined that a stronger line of defense was needed to counter the attacks. As Laser Technology advanced, a new weapon was designed to provide the next level of defense. Light Lasers are simple ground based weapons that utilize special targeting systems to track the enemy and fire a high intensity laser designed to cut through the hull of the target. In order to be kept cost effective, they were fitted with an improved shielding system, however the structural integrity is the same as that of the Rocket Launcher.<br><br> After a battle, there is up to a 70 % chance that failed defensive facilities can be returned to use.",
		"403": "The Heavy Laser is a practical, improved version of the Light Laser. Being more balanced than the Light Laser with improved alloy composition, it utilizes stronger, more densely packed beams, and even better onboard targeting systems. <br><br> After a battle, there is up to a 70 % chance that failed defensive facilities can be returned to use.",
		"404": "Far from being a science-fiction \"weapon of tomorrow,\" the concept of a weapon using an electromagnetic impulse for propulsion originated as far back as the mid-to-late 1930s. Basically, the Gauss Cannon consists of a system of powerful electromagnets which fires a projectile by accelerating between a number of metal rails. Gauss Cannons fire high-density metal projectiles at extremely high velocity. <br><br>This weapon is so powerful when fired that it creates a sonic boom which is heard for miles, and the crew near the weapon must take special precautions due to the massive concussion effects generated.",
		"405": "An ion cannon is a weapon that fires beams of ions (positively or negatively charged particles). The Ion Cannon is actually a type of Particle Cannon; only the particles used are ionized. Due to their electrical charges, they also have the potential to disable electronic devices, and anything else that has an electrical or similar power source, using a phenomena known as the the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP effect). Due to the cannons highly improved shielding system, this cannon provides improved protection for your larger, more destructive defense weapons.<br><br> After a battle, there is up to a 70 % chance that failed defensive facilities can be returned to use.",
		"406": "One of the most advanced defense weapons systems ever developed, the Plasma Turret uses a large nuclear reactor fuel cell to power an electromagnetic accelerator that fires a pulse, or toroid, of plasma. During operation, the Plasma turret first locks on a target and begins the process of firing. A plasma sphere is created in the turrets core by super heating and compressing gases, stripping them of their ions. Once the gas is superheated, compressed, and a plasma sphere is created, it is then loaded into the electromagnetic accelerator which is energized. Once fully energized, the accelerator is activated, which results in the plasma sphere being launched at an extremely high rate of speed to the intended target. From the targets perspective, the approaching bluish ball of plasma is impressive, but once it strikes, it causes instant destruction.<br><br> Defensive facilities deactivate as soon as they are too heavily damaged. After a battle, there is up to a 70 % chance that failed defensive facilities can be returned to use.",
		"407": "Colonizing new worlds brought about a new danger, space debris. A large asteroid could easily wipe out the world and all inhabitants. Advancements in shielding technology provided scientists with a way to develop a shield to protect an entire planet not only from space debris but, as it was learned, from an enemy attack. By creating a large electromagnetic field around the planet, space debris that would normally have destroyed the planet was deflected, and attacks from enemy Empires were thwarted. The first generators were large and the shield provided moderate protection, but it was later discovered that small shields did not afford the protection from larger scale attacks. The small shield dome was the prelude to a stronger, more advanced planetary shielding system to come.<br><br> After a battle, there is up to a 70 % chance that failed defensive facilities can be returned to use.",
		"408": "The Large Shield Dome is the next step in the advancement of planetary shields, it is the result of years of work improving the Small Shield Dome. Built to withstand a larger barrage of enemy fire by providing a higher energized electromagnetic field, large domes provide a longer period of protection before collapsing.<br><br> After a battle, there is up to a 70 % chance that failed defensive facilities can be returned to use.",
		"502": "Anti Ballistic Missiles (ABM) are your only line of defence when attacked by Interplanetary Missiles (IPM) on your planet or moon. When a launch of IPMs is detected, these missiles automatically arm, process a launch code in their flight computers, target the inbound IPM, and launch to intercept. During the flight, the target IPM is constantly tracked and course corrections are applied until the ABM reaches the target and destroys the attacking IPM. Each ABM destroys one incoming IPM.",
		"503": "Interplanetary Missiles (IPM) are your offensive weapon to destroy the defences of your target. Using state of the art tracking technology, each missile targets a certain number of defences for destruction. Tipped with an anti-matter bomb, they deliver a destructive force so severe that destroyed shields and defences cannot be repaired. The only way to counter these missiles is with ABMs.",
		"601": "The Geologist is a recognized expert in astromineralogy and crystallography. He and his team of metallurgists and chemists support interplanetary governments in developing new sources of resources and optimizing their purification.",
		"602": "The Admiral is a seasoned veteran and a brilliant strategist. Even in the hottest battles, he does not lose sight of the situation and maintains contact with the admirals under him. A wise ruler can completely rely on him in battle, and thus use more ships for battle.",
		"603": "The Engineer is a specialist in energy management. In peacetime, he increases the level of energy networks on the colonies. In the event of an attack, he supplies the energy systems of planetary defenses and prevents overloads, which leads to a significantly lower degree of losses in battle.",
		"604": "The Technocrat Guild are brilliant scientists, and they can always be found where the edge of the technically possible ends. Their code will never be deciphered no normal person, and their mere presence inspires the scientists of the empire.",
		"605": "An architect is an indispensable specialist in any construction. Thanks to research and experiments related to the design solution, author's supervision of construction and a scientific approach, it allows to speed up construction and increase the efficiency of builders.",
